PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The E-Charging Operators (equivalent of today's petrol pump operators) need a prediction to ensure their customers (end-users) satisfaction and optimum utilization of the e-Charging stations. 
The operator may have fast or slow charging infrastructure with their own payment terms and timings.
 With the help of machine learning algorithms the operator can offer dynamic pricing at stipulated times and manage the peak demand accordingly.
The pricing structure can also be based on the more or less charging time taken.

REQUIREMENTS:
1.Web browser
2.Data set
3.Python
4.Django framework
5.xampp

Project Description
In this project three types of machine learning algorithms are used for prediction.
They are 
1.Kmeans 
2.Linear regression
3.Decision Tree
This project helps the E charging operators to find the proper pricing structure of their E charging stations according to the fast or slow charging infrastructure.

PROPOSED SYSTEM
In this system, Using the Machine learning algorithms like K-means, Linear Regression and decision tree algorithms the pricing structure according to the demand and the infrastructure is predicted.
It was done by finding the prediction score and accuracy for each algorithms and selecting an algorithm which has the high accuracy rate compared to the other two.

PROJECT DONE TILL NOW
The first output will be prediction of all the algorithms and the visualization of K means clustering.
After the prediction all the algorithm’s prediction score is considered and the accuracy value of each algorithm is found out.
By comparing all the accuracy value, the algorithm which has the highest accuracy rate is considered as the best and suitable algorithm for the given problem statement and data set.
